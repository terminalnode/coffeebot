# Coffee Bot
It's written in Java and it's a bot, so Coffee Bot is what we're going with.

## Functionality
Very little. Hoping to expand to "not a lot" in the near future.

## Installation
You will need to create a file called `config` in the project root. On the first line of this document put your bot's token, on the second line put your own Discord ID. Note that your Discord ID is not the same as your username, the ID is a long string of numbers and nothing else. You can get this by toggling developer mode, right-clicking your name and copy ID. A more hacky way to get it is to mention yourself in Discord and add a backslash before the mention, which should send a message that says `<@!YOURID>` (feel free to use this on all of your friends as well).
